# task-3-week-2-Robot-Image-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
Task Overview:

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify robot images into two distinct categories:
	1.	Robot Arm â€“ Robots equipped with industrial robotic arms.
	2.	Humanoid Robot â€“ Robots designed with a human-like appearance (head, body, limbs).

The goal is to enable the model to analyze any new, unseen image and predict the appropriate class based on the features learned during training.
