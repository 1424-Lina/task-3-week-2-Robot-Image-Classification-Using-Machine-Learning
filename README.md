# task-3-week-2-Robot-Image-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
Task Overview:

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify robot images into two distinct categories:
	1.	Robot Arm â€“ Robots equipped with industrial robotic arms.
	2.	Humanoid Robot â€“ Robots designed with a human-like appearance (head, body, limbs).

The goal is to enable the model to analyze any new, unseen image and predict the appropriate class based on the features learned during training.

ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools Used:
	â€¢	Teachable Machine by Google
	â€¢	Python programming language
	â€¢	Keras / TensorFlow libraries
	â€¢	Google Colab for cloud-based testing
	â€¢	Pillow library for image processing

â¸»

ðŸ“¥ Project Outputs:
	â€¢	A trained model (keras_model.h5)
	â€¢	Class label file (labels.txt)
	â€¢	Python script for image preprocessing and prediction
	â€¢	Ready for future extension with more robot categories
ðŸ“Œ How It Works:
	1.	A new image is uploaded into the system.
	2.	The image is processed and passed through the trained model.
	3.	The model outputs the predicted class along with a confidence score.

âœ… Project Objective:

To build an intelligent system that can distinguish between different types of robots automatically. This can be applied to:
	â€¢	Automated image classification pipelines
	â€¢	Industrial robotics monitoring systems
	â€¢	Intelligent search in image databases
